goroutine_1 -> n: Start Read (lock)
Activate n
goroutine_2 -->x n: Start Write (lock)
Activate goroutine_2
note right: wait for mutex unlock
n -> goroutine_1: End Read (lock)
Deactivate n
goroutine_2 -> n: Start Write (lock)
Deactivate goroutine_2
Activate n
n -> goroutine_2: End Write (lock)
Deactivate n
