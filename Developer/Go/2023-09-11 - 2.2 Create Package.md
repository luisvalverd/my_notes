# 2023-09-11 - 1.2.2 Create Package


## Example:

firts to create a new package in go we need to create folder of our project

```bash
cd ~/src
mkdir -r golang-book/chapter11
cd golang-book/chapter11
```

we move to the folder source called `src` and create a new folder recursive `golang-book/chapter11`.

```bash
touch main.go
```

Now we create a new file called `main.go` witch contain this:

```go
package main

import "fmt"
import "golang-book/chapter11/math"

func main() {
	xs := []float64{1,2,3,4}
	avg := math.Average(xs)
	fmt.Println(avg)
}
```

now inside in `chapter11` create a new folder called math. And in this folder create a file called `math.go`

```bash
mkdir math
touch math/math.go
```

in this file containt

```go
package math

func Average(xs []float64) float64 {
	total := float64(0)

	for _, x := range xs {
		total += x
	}

	return total / float64(len(xs))
}
```

And just use the terminal and execute  `go install` and now this compile math
