# 2023-09-28 - 18.4 Unmarshalling and Marshalling JSON

### Common pitfalls with JSON unmarshalling in Go

While JSON unmarshalling is relatively simplex task in Go, but several commons pitfalls that we should be aware of to avoid mistakes in your business logic.

#### 1. Extra fields are omitted in the target struct

If the input JSON contains additional fields that are not a part of the target struct fields, they will be discarded when unmarshalled. This make use the struct `Dog` 

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"encoding/json"
	"log"
)

type Dog struct {
	Breed string
	Age int
	Name string
	FavoriteTreat string
}

func main() {
	input := `{
		"Breed": "Golden Retriever",
        "Age": 8,
        "Name": "Paws",
        "FavoriteTreat": "Kibble",
        "Dislikes": "Cats"}`

	var dog Dog

	err := json.Unmarshal([]byte(input), &dog)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("unable to marshal JSON due to %s", err)
	}
	
	fmt.Println(dog)
}
```

This will not add the other field in struct in this example no added `Dislikes` field in dog struct.
