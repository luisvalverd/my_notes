#### Sends and receives are blocking by default

Sends and receives to a channel are blocking by default. When data is sent to a channel, the control is blocked in the send statemen until some other Goroutine reads from that channel. Similarly, when data is read fro a channel, the read is blocked until some Goroutine writes data to that channel.

```go
element := <-Mychannel
```

For indicate to that element receives data from the channel(Mychannel). if result of received statement is not going to use is also valid statement.

```go
<- Mychannel
```
## Example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func myfunc(ch chan int) {
	fmt.Println(234 + <-ch)
}
func main() {
	fmt.Println("start Main method")

	ch := make(chan int)

	go myfunc(ch)
	ch <- 23
	fmt.Println("End main method")
}
```
