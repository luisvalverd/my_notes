# 2023-08-28 - 17.1 Mutex

Go allow us to run code concurrently using goroutines. 
Mutexes are data structure provide by the `sync`package. They can help us a __lock on different sections of data__ so can only one goroutine can access it a time.

### Using A Mutex to Lock Data

Let's take a look at an example where concurrent goroutines can corrupt a piece of data by accessing it simultaneously.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func isEven(n int) bool {
	return n % 2 == 0
}

func main() {
	n := 0

	// goroutine 1
	go func() {
		nIsEven := isEven(n)
		// sleep 500 milisecond
		time.Sleep(5 * time.Millisecond)
		if nIsEven {
			fmt.Println(n, " is even")
			return
		}
		fmt.Println(n, " is odd")
	}()

	go func() {
		n++
	}()

	time.Sleep(time.Second)
}
```

This happens because goroutine 1 actually access to `n` after: once to check it is even , and print the value. In between these steps, goroutine 2 increments the value of `n`

We should ensure that `n`should not be written to incase another goroutine is reading it, and vice versa.

For this we can use the `sync.Mutex` type to prevent multi goroutines from accessing `n`at the same time.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
	"sync"
)

func isEven(n int) bool {
	return n % 2 == 0
} 

func main() {
	n := 0
	var m sync.Mutex

	go func() {
		m.Lock()
		defer m.Unlock()
		nIsEven := isEven(n)
		time.Sleep(5 * time.Millisecond)
		if nIsEven {
			fmt.Println(n, " is even")
			return 
		}
		fmt.Println(n, " is odd")
	}()

	go func() {
		m.Lock()
		n++
		m.Unlock()
	}()

	time.Sleep(time.Second)
}
```

Calling `m.Lock`will "lock" the mutex. if any other goroutines calls `m.Lock`, it will block the thread until `m.Unlock` is called.
