# 2023-09-28 - 18.3 Unmarshalling and Marshalling JSON

### Nested Objects

Now, consider the case when we have a type specific. Using the example before,  we have a new data this is a `Dimensions`. That have to `Height` and `Length` of the a bird.

```json
{
	"species": "pigeon",
	"description": "likesto perch on rocks",
	"dimensions": {
		"height": 24,
		"width": 10
	}
}
```

As with previous example, we need to mirror the structure of the object in our Go code to add `Dimensions` object in the struct `Bird`.

```go
type Dimensions struct {
	Height int
	Width int
}
```

Now need to add dimensions filed

```go
type Bird struct {
	Species string
	Description string
	Dimensions Dimensions
}
```

```go
birdJson := `{"species":"pigeon","description":"likes to perch on rocks", "dimensions":{"height":24,"width":10}}`
var bird Bird
json.Unmarshal([]byte(birdJson), &birds)
fmt.Printf(bird)
```
