# 2023-09-14 5.2 Arrays

Arrays in golang is similar to the other program languages.

An Array is a _fixed-length_ sequence that is use to store homogeneous elements in memory.

In a array can store of zero to more elements in it. This elements are indexed by using the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">[ ]</mark> index operator with their zero-based position.

#### Syntaxis

```
var array_name[length]Type
```

the arrays in go is mutable we can assignment elements using 

```
var array_name[index] = element
```

* We can access to the elements of the array by using the index value using a loop
* In go the arrays are **one-dimensional**
- The length of array is fixed and this length are unchangeable 

#### Shorthand declaration

```
name_array := [length]type{item1, item2, item3, ... itemN}
```

## Example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// declaration the array
	students := [5]string{"luis", "pedro", "maria", "juan", "miguel"}

	fmt.Println("list of the students: ")

	// access all the elements of the array
	for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
		fmt.Println(students[i])	
	}
}
```
