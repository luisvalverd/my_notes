# 2023-09-23 - 13.1 Goroutines

Goroutines allow us to write concurrent programs in Go. Things like web servers handling thousand of request or a website rendering new pages while also concurrently makeing network request are a few example of concurrency.

This function execute a independency and simultaneously function.

We can considerate a Goroutine like a light weighted thread. The cost to create a goroutine is small compared with to the thread.

>[!Goroutines]
>Every program contains a single Goroutine and that Goroutine is know as the `main Goroutine` that mean all Goroutines are working under main Goroutine .
>If the main Goroutine terminate all Goroutines also terminate

The communication of the Goroutine is for `channels` this is the form to Goroutines communicate among themselves.
## Example

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func sum(s []int, c chan int) {
	sum := 0
	for _, v := range s{
		sum += v
	}
	c <- sum
}

func main() {
	 s := []int{7, 2, 8, -9, 4,8}

	c := make(chan int)
	go sum(s[:len(s)/2], c)
	go sum(s[len(s)/2], c)
	x, y := <- c, <- c

	fmt.Println(x, y, x+y)
}
```
