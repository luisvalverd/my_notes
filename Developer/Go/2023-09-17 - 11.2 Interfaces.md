# 2023-09-17 - 11.2 Interfaces

A interface is a form to handle multiple types for example strucst what this have a functions similars but each of them have a different type and when i hanlde some function with return can use a interface to make a function with a handle this function return in diferents types.

A example of this is when i have a some class in this case I explain with electro domestics we have a function and this is a socket where a connect owns home appliances.

And we have some home appliances all need connected to the socket to work but all home appliances have a different a works how volts and amperes we don't use directly this socket for all home appliances. 

In this case we if a want to use this function `socket` we need a plug. This is a interface we can declare this functions  can use in a same type from another structs.
## Example:

```go
package main

func main() {
  
}
```
