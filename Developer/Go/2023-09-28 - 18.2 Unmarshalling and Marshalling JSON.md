# 2023-09-28 - 18.2 Unmarshalling and Marshalling JSON

### JSON Array

Using the example before we can add various birds in an array. like bellow

```json
[
	{
		"species": "pigeon",
		"description": "likes to path on rocks"
	},
	{
		"species": "eagle",
		"description": "bird of prey"
	}
]
```

Since each element of the array has a structure of the `Bird` struct

```go
birdJson := `[{"species":"pigeon","description":"likes to path on rocks"},{"species":"eagle","description":"bird of prey"}]`
var birds []Bird
json.Unmarshal([]byte(birdJson), &birds)
fmt.Printf("Birds: %v", birds)
```
