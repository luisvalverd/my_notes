# 2023-09-28 - 17.4 Mutex

We can explain mutex how a function that make to lock a goroutine to write /read data. for example if we have a data. first goroutine reads value to show to the user data, and the second goroutine writes value.

All this can run concurrently this execute in this case first goroutine 1 start to read the data for _(this example this function take 5 seconds to finish this task)_ goroutine 2 access data too in this case goroutine 1 has a one value and goroutine 2 change this value.  And this make a error because we show a value is other to the goroutine 2 has.

To solve this problem we can use mutex this lock a goroutine to make a change while the other goroutine want to access wait for unlock data.

With this we can handle data using concurrently without other goroutine change something while this it is nor ready.
