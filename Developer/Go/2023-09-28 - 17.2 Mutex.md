### Reader/Writer Mutex - The sync.RWMutex Type

Sometimes, it is for data to have concurrent reads, as long as the writes stay atomic.
In this case, we can a `sync.RWMutex`type, which has different locks for reading and writing to data

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

func isEven(n int) bool {
	return n % 2 == 0
}

func main() {
	n := 0
	var m sync.RWMutex

	// goroutine 1
	go func() {
		m.RLock()
		defer m.RUnlock()
		nIsEven := isEven(n)
		time.Sleep(time.Second)
		if nIsEven {
			fmt.Println(n, " is even")
			return
		}
		fmt.Println(n, " is odd")
	}()

	// goroutine 2
	go func() {
		m.RLock()
		defer m.RUnlock()
		nIsPositive := n > 0
		time.Sleep(time.Second)
		if nIsPositive {
			fmt.Println(n , " is positive")
			return
		}
		fmt.Println(n, " is not positive")
	}()

	// goroutine 3
	go func() {
		m.Lock()
		n++
		m.Unlock()
	}()

	time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
}
```

When running this code, we can observe that goroutines 1 and 2 can access `n`concurrently, but the __reads (1 and 2) and writes (3) are locked from each other__
