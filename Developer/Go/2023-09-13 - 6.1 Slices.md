# 2023-09-13 6.2 Slices

The slices are flexible and efficient way to present array. Their are used in place of the array because their are dynamic size and added features.

it's a data structure that this describes a portion of the array indicate the starting index and the length of the a portion.

This allows work with a portion of the array as if it were independent array.
This more powerful, flexible and convenient structure data than an array.

- this not allowed store diferent types of elements in the same slices.
- The size of slices are resized.

>[!NOTE] 
>_the first index of position in a slice is always 0 and the last one will be (length of slice - 1)_

#### Syntax

```
slice_name := []datatype{values}
```

A common declaration is

``` go
mySlice:= []string{}
```

## Example:

#### Create a slice of the array in go 

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	array := []int{1,2,3}
	slice := array[1:4] 

	fmt.Println("array: ", array)
	fmt.Println("slice: ", slice)
}
```

#### Add elements to slice

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	numbers := []int{1, 2, 3}
	numbers := append(numbres, 4, 5, 6)

	fmt.Println("Slice: " numbres)
}
```

#### Create a slice using make function

make function is a a function provided for go library. This function is take three parameters i.e , type, length and capacity. The capacity is optional 

##### Syntax

```
func make([]T, len cap) []T
```

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

	var slice1 = make([]int, 4, 7) 
	fmt.Printf("slice 1 = %v \nlength = %d, \ncapacity = %d\n", 
		slice1, len(slice1), cap(slice1))

	var slice2 = make([]int, 7)
	fmt.Prinlf("slice 2 + %v \nlength = %d, \ncapacity = %d\n",
		slice2, len(slice2), cap(slice2))
}
```
