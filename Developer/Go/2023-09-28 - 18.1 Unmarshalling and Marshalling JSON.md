# 2023-09-28 - 18.1 Unmarshalling and Marshalling JSON

JSON is a simple data interchange format. Their syntax are similar to objects and list of javascript.
This is commonly used to communication between web back-end and JavaScript programs in browser.

### Unmarshalling (Parsing) Raw JSON String

The `unmarshal` function provided by Go __JSON stand library__ lets us parse raw JSON data in the from of `[]byte`variables.

```go
import "encoding/json"
//...

//...
myJsonString := `{"some":"json"}`

// '&myStoreVariable' is the address of the variable we want to store our
// parsed data in
json.Unmarshall([]byte(myJsonString), &myStoreVariable)
//...
```

let's look at the different variable types of `myStoreVariable`, and when you should use them.

There are two types of your data will encounter when working with JSON.

1. Structured data
2. Unstructured data

### Structured Data (Decoding JSON Into Structs)

"Structured data" when we know the format data beforehand. For example let's say you have a bird object. This object is a _birs_ this has a `species` and `description`fields.

```JSON
{
	"species": "pigeon",
	"description": "likes to perch on rocks"
}
```

To work with this kind of data, create a `struct` that mirrors the data you want to parse. In our case, we will create a bird struct which has a `species`and `description`.

```go
type Bird struct {
	Species string
	Description string
}
```

And unmarshall it as bellows:

```go
birdJson := `{"species": "pigeon", "description": "likes to perch on rocks"}`
var bird Bird
json.Unmarshall([]byte(birdJson), &bird)
fmt.Printf("Species: %s, Description: %s", bird.Species, bird.Description)
```
