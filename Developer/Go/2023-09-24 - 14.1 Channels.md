# 2023-09-24 - 14.1 Channels

Channels are the pipes that connect concurrent goroutines. With this we can send values into channels from one Goroutine and receive those values into another goroutine.

#### declaring channels

Each channel has a type associated with it. And this type is the type of data that the channel is allowed transport. This means than the channel can't transport a other type not allowed for the channel.

``` 
chan T -> is a channel of type `T`
```

The channels has to be defined using `make` similar to maps and slices

## Example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var a chan int
	if a == nil {
		fmt.Println("Channel a is nil, going to define it")
		a = make(chan int)
		fmt.Printf("type of a iis %T", a)
	}
}
```

As usual, the short hand declaration is also a valid and concise way todefine a channel.

```go
a := make(chan int)
```

#### Systax to receiving from a channel

```go
data := <- a // read fro channel a
a <- data // write to channel a
```
