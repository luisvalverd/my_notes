# 2023-09-14 - 9.1 Structs

A structure or struct is a user-defined type that allows to group/combine items, of different types in a single type. It has a properties/fields can be represent a struct.

This is compared with the classes in object-oriented programming 

#### Declaring a structure

```go
type Address struct {
	name string
	street string
	city string
	state string
	Pincode int
}
```

In this the `type` keyword introduces a new type. this is follow by the name of the type _Address_ and the keyword `struct` illustrate that we're defined a struct. and this contain a various fields inside curly braces.

>[!NOTE]
>We can compact a fields of the same type 

for example:

```go
type Address struct {
	name, street, city, state string
	Pincode int
}
```

#### To define a structure

in this case we can use the below syntax

```go
var a Address
```

the above code create a structure which value default set to zero. This corresponding all values initialized in zero value.

We can initialized struct using literal below:

```go
var a = Address{"Akshay", "PremNagar", "Dehradun", "Uttarakhand", 232554}
```

## Example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Address struct {
	Name string
	city string
	Pincode int
}

func main() {
    var a Address
    fmt.Println(a)

	a1 := Address{"Boliver", "Quito", 1234}
	fmt.Println(a1)

	a2 := Address{Name: "Bolivar", city: "Quito", Pincode: 1234}
	fmt.Println(a2)

	a3 := Address{Name: "Bolivar"}
	fmt.Println(a3)
}
```

#### Access to field using (.)

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Car struct {
	Name, Model, Color string
	WeightInkg float64
}

func main() {
	c := Car{Name: "Ferrari", Model: "La ferrari", Color: "red", price: 1800}

	fmt.Println("car name: ", c.Name)
	fmt.Println("car color: ", c.Color)

	c.Color = "black"

	fmt.Println("car: ", c)
}
```
