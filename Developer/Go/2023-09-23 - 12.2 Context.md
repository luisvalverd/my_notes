# 2023-09-23 - 12.2 Context

Imagine, the client of application need information of th database, but the client sometimes when the client makes a request this disconnected before of the request complete.  In this case the program don't know that client is disconnected and the program is trying send this information a client. When our application try to complete the request this has a much cost of the processing.

For to solve this problem we have a context package, this such as the client connection status, and allows to the application stop processing the request once client disconnects.

And now we can mean the context as a package that provide a information of the other things.
